# LefttoRight

A simple, minimalistic, boring, buggy 2D platformer made with C++ using OpenGL and SOIL/STB.

# Usage
You'll need all assets (ending in .png) to have proper textures in the game and not white quads rendered everywhere.

# Compilation
LefttoRight was compiled using Visual Studio 2017 on Windows 10. 

If you would like to play the game without worrying about this, you may use the pre-compiled binaries in /Debug (launch the exe).

# Controls

```
W or D - Move forwards
S or A - Move backwards
Space - Jump
Y - Toggle FPS display
```
The use of arrow keys is not supported at this time.

# Footnote
This project was intended for fun and getting into OpenGL. I'll add more features if I ever find the time.
Feel free to contribute.
